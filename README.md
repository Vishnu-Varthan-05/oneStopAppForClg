One-Stop App for College Information & Engagement
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application that consolidates and centralizes access to college information. This app aims to replace reliance on scattered emails, offering students a single source for timetables, webinars, campus events, and competition details, thereby enhancing student engagement in campus activities.

Existing Methodology
Currently, our college relies on email communication to circulate information. However, this method has several drawbacks:

Scattered Information: Emails get buried in inboxes, making it difficult to find specific information later.
Lack of Organization: Important deadlines and event details can easily get lost.
Passive Consumption: Students need to actively check their emails for updates, leading to missed opportunities.
Limited Functionality: Emails lack features like centralized overview and wishlists for events, webinars, and competitions.
These limitations can lead to information overload, missed deadlines, and disengagement from campus activities.
